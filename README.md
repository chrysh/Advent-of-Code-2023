# Advent of Code 2023

This repository includes my [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) code for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

Ah, it's that time of the year again! I haven't used Go in ages and I'm kind of inclined to do so yet again.

*If you want to solve the puzzles yourself first, do so, **then** look for the solution to compare.*
Do **not** cheat yourself out of a great time and learning experience by just copying code!

**Please keep in mind most of this is hacked together.
I don't claim it's perfect code or even in all cases 100% valid/defined/proper code or whatever.
It's for fun and it got the job done in a short amount of time.** ðŸ˜€
